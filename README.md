# Fate of the Emperor

A quick and fun Python script that randomly selects a **Warhammer 40K mission setup**

## What It Does

This script will randomly generate:
- A **Deployment** (e.g., *Tipping Point*, *Hammer, and Anvil*, etc.)  
- A **Primary Mission Objective** (e.g., *Take and Hold*, *Scorched Earth*, etc.)

Each time you run it, you’ll get a new randomized combo.
